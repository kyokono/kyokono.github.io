      <p>I’m really fed up with ubuntus lack of concern regarding their users data collection. Guess it’s time to install gentoo and get going. I might regret this decision though, so who knows. I hope I can transfer my files seamlessly, I’ll unplug the hard drives in case the partition stuff gets too crazy. I just wonder how much I’m going to lose from this, because obviously I’m going to have to wait on some large file transfers.
Oh well, looks like im going to be busy again, a rare occurance.</p>
